//Note to Marker
//I think you might notice this time around a little
//improvement in my application of BEM. This is
//primarily due to Nelson, Bahareh and Jim since I was convinced
//that BEM and SASS really don't work, leading to much
//frustration. That being said I know that this website
//is NOT responsive that is because Jim helped me get it
//that way and I changed something and could not get it
//working again. I have spent most of the weedend trying to
//this website to be responsive. That is the BAD news the
//good news is that I used BEM and SASS throughout the
//project and eventhough it is not perfect I think it looks
// much better.
